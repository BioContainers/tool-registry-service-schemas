Currently, this is the home of the Registry API proposal. The registry API is a minimal common API describing tools that we proposal for support by multiple registries like [Dockstore](https://www.dockstore.org/) and [Agora](https://github.com/broadinstitute/agora) for the purposes of exchange, indexing, and searching. 
Our current proposal is to start with a read-only API due to potentially different views and approaches to registration/security.

The entire schema is shown below, but a more useful form is the Swagger editor to view our [schema in progress](http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ga4gh/tool-registry-schemas/develop/src/main/resources/swagger/ga4gh-tool-discovery.yaml)
