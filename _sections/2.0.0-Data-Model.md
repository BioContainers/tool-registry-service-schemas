Currently, the data model is built around two main models, the Tool and the ToolVersion. A Tool describes one pairing of a tool and one Docker image. A ToolVersion describes a particular iteration of a tool as fixed by a reference to a specific image id, a Dockerfile as fixed by a URL, and a descriptor for the tool in either CWL or WDL.

Topics to cover:

* Why are we doing this
* How do we expect users (users of docker containers) to take advantage of this?
* How do we expect providers (builders of docker containers) to take advantage of this?
  * visible on many different sites
* How do we expect registry developers to benefit from this? 
  * exchange and mirror entries
* What do we want people reading the specification to do 
  * want comments and feedback 
  * want this to be the basis for people to implement 
  * disqus comments vs pull requests
  * how do we support this API (places to talk about, where people can look for feedback, etc.)
